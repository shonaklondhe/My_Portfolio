# CSRF Error Fix Applied

## Changes Made:

1. **Added CSRF Trusted Origins** in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
       'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
       'http://localhost:8000',
       'http://127.0.0.1:49306',  # Browser preview proxy
       'http://localhost:49306',
   ]
   ```

2. **Updated ALLOWED_HOSTS**:
   ```python
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']
   ```

3. **Fixed Home Page Heading**:
   - Changed from "Hi, I'm Your Name" to "Hi, I am Shonak"

## Contact Form Status:
✅ CSRF token is already present in the form (`{% csrf_token %}`)
✅ Form method is POST
✅ Email functionality is configured

## Testing:
The contact form should now work without CSRF errors. When you submit a message:
1. It will be saved to the database
2. An email will be sent to shonaklondhe.it@gmail.com (currently using console backend for development)
3. You'll see a success message

## If Issues Persist:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try in an incognito/private window
3. Check that the Django server restarted after settings changes
